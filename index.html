      This word cloud shows the words from the song <em>"Venom"</em>.
      I made this for a data structures class at Brooklyn college.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was generated by:
      <ul>
        <li>Finding the most frequent words using a hashmap. I used hashmap because it was
          convenient to pair a word with its number of occurrence, and the time complexity of inserting and accessing is constant O(1) for a
        hashmap.</li>
        <li>The code was written in Java.</li>
        <li>Using the <a href="https://github.com/kennycason/kumo">Kumo</a> Library.</li>
        <li>If i had more time to work on this project I would have liked to improve the layout of the webpage and add more content. 
        I also would have liked to try building a Gif version of this word cloud. </li>
        <li>I chose the song Venom for this project because, I listened to it and liked the song when it was originally released in Eminem's 
        Kamikaze album and the release of the Venom movie made it more meaningful and it gave the song more context</li>
        <li>Venom was released on September 21, 2018 and hit the top 50 in the United States, Canada, and Australia</li>
        <li>The top words in the lyrics were "I'm" with 33 occurrence, "and" with 30 occurrence, and "the" with 28 occurrence. 
          I wasn't surprised with the results because these are very common words that are often repeated in the English language, so I
        expected similar outcome.</li>
        
    </ul>
